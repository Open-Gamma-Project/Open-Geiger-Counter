# Open Geiger Counter

Open hardware for a simple all-in-one geiger counter design using a GMT like the popular SGM-20.

Hardware design has been done in EasyEDA and all the needed files for you to import the project as well as
a schematic can be found in the hardware folder. There is also a gerber file available for direct pcb manufacturing.

Software aims to be as simple as possible to understand and maintain; to achieve this the two ATTiny84s can be
programmed using the ArduinoIDE and a popular AVR ICSP programmer like the USBasp.

More info will follow shortly.
